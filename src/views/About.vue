            <p>St. Edmunds College Model United Nation (SECMUN) Club as an
                educational based College Club functions as a simulation on
                lines of the United Nations (UN). It calls for the mention of the
                revolutionary change of some students' with some motive in
                mind to bring up the leadership quality, to bring up the
                diplomatic conception of each of the member and to motivate
                and teach people regarding the geopolitical variations and
                areas that call for global participation and engagement. The
                formation of the Club dates back to the backdrop of the North
                East India Model United Nations (NEIMUN) Conference held at
                Shillong in the year 2014. The primary objective of the Club
                then was to spread awareness about MUN to the students of the
                College, as well as nurture aspiring participants and
                encourage them to participate in MUN events held in the North
                Eastern region.
